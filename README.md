## `charsweeper.py`

*Let the computer play MineSweeper game automatically on the console*

There remains some bugs, and usually cannot run completely. **You had better NOT run this file.**

I wrote this project when I was just begining to learn programming. Most of it was written in the summer holiday in 2018. I even didn't follow PEP-8 programming standard. The code cannot be worse both in style and in algorithm---it contains an algorithm with exponent-time complexity, causing jams. This file lives here as a kind of commemoration, never to be updated.

## `minesweeper_tk.py`

*MineSweeper game written in python based on tkinter module*

Note, if the map is too big, every updating step (especially initializing) will probably cause the processing to slow down.

It's a project for me to learn OOP programming in early time, and thus the code is still complicated. After all, it's a successful project and gave me much confidence at that time.

## `minesweeper_js`

*MineSweeper game written in javascript*

To play MineSweeper, you may simply run `mine_sweeper.html` in `minesweeper_js` folder.

This is my first javascript project.

## `autosweeper`

*Let computer play MineSweeper automatically*

You may run `python autosweeper.py` and follow the instructions. Games played can be recorded as json files and saved in `game_savings` folder, and these files can be read and displayed in the future. The `numpy` package is no longer necessary, so using pypy to run `autosweeper.py` is allowed.

Still updating. The algorithm will be updated. C++ version hasn't yet been completed. By the way, this is my first project that contains C++.
